\subsection{Problems in our society}
Our society depends on software, cars, water, energy, computers, everything is controlled by software.\\
Flawed software will hurt profits, fixing a bug after release and delivery is much more expensive than fixing it before its release. Even if bugs aren't noticeable by the end users or the company hosting it, bugs can lead to security exploits, and later breaches.\\
Flawed software can even hurt users directly, e.g. pacemaker crashing or av making a wrong turn.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is ''good" software?
	      \subitem we determine this through quality dependencies
	\item What is the key to good software?s
	      \subitem Verification and Validation.
	\item Exploration of testing and analysis activities of the V and V process
